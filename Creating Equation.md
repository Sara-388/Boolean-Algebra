<h1>Equation for motion sensing light</h1>

<h2>Unsimplified Equation</h2>

<h3>Conditions</h3>

First, I took all of the conditions that were given and translated them into an unsimplified boolean expression. 

I saw the motion and not in test mode. Motion being m and test mode being t. 
So this would become mt'

The second condition given was that it was in test mode with no motion.
This can be represented with a t and an m' so tm'

The third condition was test mode and motion.
This would be tm.

<h3>Combine</h3>

I combined all of the statements into one equation. 
I got mt' + tm' + tm
The output is i so that would be on the other side of the equation.
i =  mt' + tm' + tm

<h2>simplifying the Equation</h2>

I factored out the t because it was a common term.
The equation became i = mt' + t(m' + m)
m'+m is equal to 1.
The equation becomes 

i = mt' + t
there is an identity that says that is equal to m + t

So my final answer is i = m + t
